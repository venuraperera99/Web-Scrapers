# Web-Scrapers
Web Scrapers that were created to scrape pages that have listings of businesses for a specific business specified

These web scrapers spcifically get the phone number, address, address unit, name, state code and put it into a database so the data is organized and easily accessable.
If the program is used without the use of any website then the line of code setting 'bd_id' can be commented out. And the name and address can be specified similar
to how the comments in the code are, which will query for the business name at the address specified.
